# Beta Versions

To help folks try out new features early and provide feedback prior to releases we publish beta versions of the packages. Released as a set with matching version numbers, just like when we do a normal release. Generally every Friday a new set of beta libraries will be released. While not ready for production use we encourage you to try out these pre-release packages and provide us feedback.

## Installing

To install the beta packages in your project you use the @beta version number on the packages. This applies to all packages, not just the ones
shown in the example below.

```
npm install @pnp/logging@beta @pnp/common@beta @pnp/odata@beta @pnp/sp@beta --save
```

Please remember that it is possible something may not work in a beta version, so be aware and if you find something please [report an
issue](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues).
